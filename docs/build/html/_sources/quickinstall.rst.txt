Installation Guide
==================

NPAT is available through the `Python Package index`_, which allows installation using Python's standard command line utility `pip`_.  Assuming Python and Pip are installed already, you can install NPAT with the command::

	pip install --user npat


or::

	python -m pip install --user npat


If you'd like to install the most recent (unreleased) version of NPAT, you can clone the NPAT `github`_, and install by either running ``python -m setup.py install --user`` or ``make install``.
